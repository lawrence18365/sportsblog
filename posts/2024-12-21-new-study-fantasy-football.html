                <p>A groundbreaking study released this week has confirmed what many have suspected for years: 97% of fantasy football players are convinced that their abysmal records are solely the result of bad luck, rather than poor drafting choices, questionable starting lineups, or a general misunderstanding of how football works.</p>

                <p>"I've just been really unlucky this year," said local fantasy football enthusiast and current last-place holder in his league, Mark Johnson. "I mean, I had three of my star players get injured in Week 1, and then my kicker missed that game-winning field goal by, like, a mile. It's not my fault!"</p>

                <p>The study, conducted by the Institute for Delusional Sports Fans, surveyed thousands of fantasy football players across the country. The results were staggering: an overwhelming majority blamed their losing records on everything from injuries and bad weather to unfavorable officiating and even "cosmic forces" working against them. </p>
                
                <p>Researchers also noted a strong correlation between the number of losses a fantasy football player had and the likelihood of them blaming their significant other for "not understanding the importance of Sunday."</p>

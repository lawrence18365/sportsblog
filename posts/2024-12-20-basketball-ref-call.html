                <p>In what experts are calling an unprecedented event in professional basketball, power forward Marcus Thompson of the Chicago Bulls openly admitted that a referee's call against him was "probably fair." Sports psychologists worldwide have convened an emergency meeting to study this bizarre occurrence.</p>

                <p>"Yeah, I definitely fouled him," Thompson said in the post-game interview, causing several veteran reporters to faint and one to question everything they knew about basketball. "I mean, I basically tackled the guy while he was shooting. It wasn't subtle."</p>

                <p>The NBA has launched a full investigation into Thompson's shocking display of honesty, with concerns that this could set a dangerous precedent of players actually acknowledging their mistakes.</p>
